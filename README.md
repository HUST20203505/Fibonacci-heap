# Fibonacci-heap
Final project of data structures and algorithms: Fibonacci heap and Application

Part 1 : Fibonacci heap
Part 2 : Application
a, Shortest path algorithms: Fibonacci heap is commonly used to implement Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph.

b, Minimum spanning tree algorithms: Fibonacci heap can be used to implement Prim's algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of a weighted graph.

c,Network flow algorithms: Fibonacci heap can be used in network flow algorithms, such as the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm.

d,Job scheduling: Fibonacci heap can be used to implement priority queues in job scheduling systems, where jobs are assigned priorities based on their importance.

In this repository includes part 1 and part 2c
